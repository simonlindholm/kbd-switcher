Firefox extension which changes keyboard layout to Swedish on http://www.funbeat.se/, https://www.facebook.com/ and some accounts on https://mail.google.com/.

Preserved mostly for historial value. It is likely to break when e10s hits.

The extension is specific to Linux, and requires https://github.com/ierton/xkb-switch to be installed in /usr/local/bin.

MIT-licensed, for no particular reason.
